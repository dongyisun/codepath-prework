**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Dongyi Sun**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pumped-exuberant-profit)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- The button could change the location each run. The user could click the button by its color.
- User could test the button with the sound to sure that he click the right button. Thus, we could set up a attpempt time for user to try. When the game gets more complex and have more buttons.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I think the HTML part and CSS parts are not difficult for me. However, when I start to work on the java part, it takes me more time complete the requirements. The most challenging part was in the additional features. It is not like the tutorials. If you cannot complete the requirement, you can just go back to the tutorial and find the answer. The additional features have hints under each section. Thus, I usually think about how I am going to add these functions without reading hints. If it takes more than five minutes, I will read the hints and start to work on it. If I still cannot complete it, I will search on google. I searched for the CSS style sheets on google. Other than that, it does not take me so long to complete it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I feel like I do not have enough knowledge of java. I still need to learn more and practice more about it. It was not hard to complete the prework by following the tutorial. However, if there is no hint or tutorial, it might take me a long time to complete it by searching HTML, CSS, and java. I hope I could practice more during the internship this summer If I could have the chance to work on the code path.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I will work on the additional features. It is more challenging for me. Especially, the last two additional features. Because if the tutorial is there, I would think if I cannot overcome it, I have a backup plan. I could always see the right answer there. However, the additional features allow me to try it again and again until I get it right. For the last three additional features, I think I could use getElementById('image) to display the time when the user clicks the button. I could set up a duration valuable timeout or set interval to limit the time that the user could react to the game. I hope I could have a few hours to work on these two functions.
